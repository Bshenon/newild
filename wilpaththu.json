    "willInfo":"While Wilpattu was first designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back as 1905, it wasn’t until February 1938 that this 13,500-hectare park was elevated to national park status. Yet, its story begins much earlier than this. The copper shoreline of the reserve, specifically at Kudiramalai, a rocky promontory, is widely believed to have been the landing spot of the Indian Prince Vijaya in the 5th century BC. He married Princess Kuveni of Sri Lanka, and together they established the Sinhalese race. The region’s alternative name – Thambapanni or the ‘colour of copper’ – came about due to the reddish colour of the sand that stained the hands and feet of Prince Vijaya and his 700-odd followers when they came ashore. The ruins of Kuveni’s palace is just one of 68 archeological sites within Wilpattu National Park.",
    "willinfoOne":"The Mahavansa records that in 543 BC Prince Vijaya landed at Tambapanni now known as Kudrimalai Point (Horse Point), established the Sinhalese kingdom in Tambapanni and founded the Sinhala nation. In 1905 the area was designated a sanctuary and in 1938 it was upgraded to the National Park status.Kudrimalai, or Horse Point, was visited by a subject of Emperor Claudius in 47 AD, who was blown off course by the monsoon. The local king later sent his own envoys to Rome during the time of Pliny.",
    "moreinfo":"The boundary of the Wilpattu national park originally enclosed the Puttalam District in the south and Anuradhapura District in the east.[4][5][6][7] On October 10, 2012, the government published several gazettes (section 3 of the forest conservation ordinance, chapter 451) which effectively extended the park's boundary to include regions of the northern province.[8][9] The expansion of the Wilpattu National Park boundary in 2012 is considered a significant obstacle for internally displaced people, particularly those affected by the Expulsion of Muslims from the Northern Province of Sri Lanka by the LTTE to return to their homeland"
